The model represents distinct microbial species as matrices that describe their net conversion rates in the form A -> nB, where A is the metabolite consumed, B is the metabolite excreted into a shared environment, and n is a stoichiometric constant. Additionally, the species housing the above net conversion (or reaction), will have generated some value (energy) during the process, which contributes to its own growth. Once excreted, metabolite B may be utilized by a different species, enabling cross-feeding (syntrophy) between the populations present in the community. The model incorporates a feeding term that describes the type and amount of resources that flow into the system per unit time. All observed growth in the community can be derived from this inflow of resources: some species will be able to directly consume the resources flowing into the habitat (as a renewable or depletable resource), while the preferred resources for other species will be the byproducts of the reaction(s) performed by different species.","category":"page"},{"location":"readme/#Applicability","page":"Home","title":"Applicability","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"readme/","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Simulate the growth of an initially populated microbial community and find the equilibrium abundances\nSimulate the succession of an initially empty microbial habitat where colonizers appear one by one\nSimulate the resilience of a microbial community against invaders appearing one by one","category":"page"},{"location":"readme/#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"readme/","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"To install MiCroSim.jl directly from the github repository, use:","category":"page"},{"location":"readme/","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using Pkg\nPkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/Jakab-Mate/MiCroSim.jl.git\")","category":"page"},{"location":"readme/#Workflow","page":"Home","title":"Workflow","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"readme/","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The functions in this package rely on each other's outputs, so generally you will want to use them in the following order:","category":"page"},{"location":"readme/","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"create_metabolism(...)<span style=\"display:inline-block; width: 56px;\"></span>Generates the set of possible reactions (net conversions), or in other words a universal metabolism.
